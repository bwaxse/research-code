    "# GENOTYPE EXTRACTION\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to extract genotypes for specific genetic variants across all participants from the All of Us Researcher Workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WORKFLOW OVERVIEW:\n",
    "1. Set up environment and utility functions\n",
    "2. Configure paths and database connections\n",
    "3. Load and explore genomic data using Hail\n",
    "4. Extract genotypes for one or more specified variants\n",
    "5. Create a genotype matrix (participants × variants)\n",
    "6. (Optional) Add clinical/demographic data\n",
    "\n",
    "## KEY FEATURES:\n",
    "- Extract genotypes for **multiple variants simultaneously**\n",
    "- Creates a wide-format DataFrame with one column per variant\n",
    "- Each column shows actual genotypes (0/0, 0/1, 1/1) for all participants\n",
    "- Handles multi-allelic sites automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "## LEARNING OBJECTIVES:\n",
    "- Understand Hail MatrixTable structure for genomic data\n",
    "- Learn how to query specific genetic variants\n",
    "- Extract participant genotypes across multiple variants\n",
    "- Create analysis-ready genotype matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "## OUTPUT FORMAT:\n",
    "The function returns a Polars DataFrame with structure:\n",
    "- **Columns**: person_id, chr#:pos:ref:alt (one column per variant)\n",
    "- **Values**: \"0/0\", \"0/1\", \"1/1\", or null (missing)\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
